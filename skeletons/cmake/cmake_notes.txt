1. make a folder for your current homework

mkdir homeworkx
cd homeworkx

cp some/path/CMakeLists.mpi.c.txt homeworkx/CMakeLists.txt

(or substitute other languages as needed)

4. edit the cmake file for your program name

To use cmake:

1. make a build directory, for instance in your homework dir

cd homeworkx
mkdir build

2. go there and make your program:

cd build
cmake ..
make

3. run your program, on a TACC compute node

idev # or submit a batch job
ibrun yourprogram
